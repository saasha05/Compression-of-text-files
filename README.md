# Compression-of-text-files
Explore howtext files can be compressed by using a coding scheme based on the frequency of characters. We will use a
coding scheme called Huffman coding. The basic idea is to abandon the way that text files are usually stored.
Instead of using the usual seven or eight bits per character, Huffman's method uses only a few bits for characters
that are used often, more bits for those that are rarely used.
